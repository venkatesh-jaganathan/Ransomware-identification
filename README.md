# Ransomware-identification
Crypto ransomware is one of the challenging threats that incorporate advanced encryption algorithms to block system files and demand payment to provide the victim with the key that can decrypt the blocked content. The spread of ransomware which is increasing as traditional detection-based protection, such as antivirus and anti-malware, has proven ineffective at preventing attacks. Cyber criminals simply look for the easiest way to infect a system or network and use that backdoor to spread the malicious contents. Encrypting ransomware targets businesses both small and large as well as the regular home user. In this type of attack, hackers install code on a phishing website that redirects computer users to malicious sites. This system discusses the security mechanisms that can be undertaken to identify the ransomware activities in the website and to help prevent becoming the next victim. In case of phishing website the researchers try to discover whether the intention is ransomware kind of attack using honeypot analysis.
